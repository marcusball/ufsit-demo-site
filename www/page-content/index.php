                        <p>You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.</p>
                        <p>Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Noooooo! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.</p>

						<p>I don't want to be rescued. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. I don't want to be rescued. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute.</p>
						<p>Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. With gusto. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.</p>
						<p>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Daylight and everything. We don't have a brig. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! File not found.</p>

                        <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

						<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

						<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>
